# Data Loading Utilities

Inside the **dataloaders** directory within this repository, you can discover a collection of useful scripts and classes designed to facilitate data loading, preprocessing, and management for the project centered around remote sensing image captioning. Below, you'll find a concise overview of the contents housed within this directory:

## Contents
- `__init__.py`: This script serves as the entry point, incorporating other module directories and orchestrating the data splitting process into training, testing, and validation subsets.

- `crawler.py`: Within this script, you'll encounter functions that facilitate the extraction of data from the dataset directory.

- `dataset.py`: Enclosed here is a dataset class meticulously crafted to oversee the organization of data for training, validation, and testing purposes. Its role is pivotal in efficiently retrieving individual data samples.

- `preprocess.py`: This script offers an optional alternative prepossessing approach, granting you flexibility in how you preprocess the data.

## Acknowledgments

The dataloaders directory's components, responsible for data loading and preprocessing, have been meticulously developed by drawing insights from the realms of data management, image processing, and natural language processing.

For those seeking a more profound comprehension and contextual understanding, don't hesitate to delve into the codebase and peruse the comprehensive documentation provided within the dataloaders directory.
